Geographically weighted regression models are an effective way to address this problem by allowing for local variation in the relationship between the response variable and the predictor variables. However, creating accurate geographically weighted regression models can be a complex and time-consuming process that requires specialized knowledge and software. Additionally, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging due to the local nature of the models.\n\n\nCase Study\nAnalysing vaccination rates is crucial in the current climate as the world is grappling with a global pandemic caused by COVID-19. Vaccination üíâ is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and protect communities from illness and death. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccination data, we can gain important insights into the progress of immunization campaigns and help identify areas where more resources and efforts are needed to increase vaccine uptake. Additionally, analyzing vaccination rates can inform public health policies and interventions aimed at improving vaccine distribution, accessibility, and equity, particularly for vulnerable populations who may face barriers to vaccination.\nWe will be using the above-mentioned case study to design and test our geospatial analytics tool üòÉ\n\n\nKey Objectives\nOur project aims to create a web-based geospatial analytics tool that helps users create and evaluate geographical regression models easily by:\n\nimporting data üìÅ\nidentifying significant regressors in the model üîç\ncreating customised Linear and Geographically Weighted Models üìà\nevaluating the models based on a variety of statistical tests üß™\n\n\n\n\nTo build and test our application, we will be modeling the vaccination rate of DKI, Jakarta in the various sub-districts based on a variety of socio-economic factors.\n\nTable 1: Datasets used\n\n\nName\nSource\n\n\n\n\nNumber of school facilities\ndata.humdata.org\n\n\nNumber of health care facilities\ndata.humdata.org\n\n\nDKI Jakarta Map Boundary\nindonesia-geospasial.com\n\n\nNumber of COVID-19 cases per sub-district\nriwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com\n\n\nPopulation density of the various sub-districts in DKI Jakarta (2019)\ndata.jakarta.go.id\n\n\nMale to female ratio of the various sub-districts in DKI Jakarta\nNumber of Elderly in the sub-districts of DKI Jakarta\ndata.jakarta.go.id\n\n\nNumber of Educated people per sub-district\ndata.jakarta.go.id\n\n\nNumber of health workers per sub-district\ndata.jakarta.go.id\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have identified studies that have attempted to perform similar types of analyses:\n\n1.

A geographically weighted regression approach to investigate the effect of traffic conditions and road characteristics on air pollutant emissions\n\nTable 4: Details of Study #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effects of traffic, road network, employment and social demographic characteristics on air pollutant emissions at the level of traffic analysis zone (TAZ).\n\n\n\nIn deriving an appropriate regression model, the authors also compared the use of geographically weighted regressions and the conventional generalised linear regression model to link pollutant concentrations with various contributory variables.\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\nLinear Regression analysis - if a candidate variable and its quadratic and cubic terms are all insignificant, this variable will not be retained in the GWR models\nPearson Correlation Coefficients were calculated to ensure highly correlated variables were not simultaneously included in the model.\nBest combination of explanatory variables determined by AICc.\nGWR model - used Kriging Interpolation method to get the pollutant concentrations\n\ncorrelation analysis conducted between candidate exploratory variables\n\nUsed 10-fold cross validation of different models to infer how much prediction accuracy increases based on changes made to the model\n\n\n\nKey Learning Points\n\nGWR can effectively overcome the limitation of Generalised Linear Model (GLM) in modeling the pollutant concentrations at the Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) level.\nConstraining the parameters to be constant may lead to biased parameter estimates.\n\n\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nNIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation\n\nImport data into R environment\nPerform data wrangling - Kriging Interpolation Method\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nEDA helps users to understand the data distribution, detect outliers, and identify any missing values. This helps us evaluate the that the assumptions of statistical tests are met before performing them. EDA also helps users generate hypotheses that can guide further investigations of the issue at hand.\n\nDraw Histograms\nCreate Choropleth Map\nCheck if statistical test assumptions are met\n\nLinear Regression (OLS)\nPerforming Ordinary Least Squares regression before GWR is important as it provides a globel model for the data. It can help identify overall trends and relationships in the data. By comparing the results of OLS and GWR, users can better understand how relationship between variables vary across space and make more informed decisions.\n\nGeneralised Multiple Linear Regression Method\nStepwise forward regression (focus on covariates with highest increase in \\(R^2\\) and \\((VIF) < 3\\)\nUsing stepwise forward regression helps users identify the most important predictors of a response variable while avoiding overfitting of the model.\n\nGeographically Weighted Regression (GWR)\nAs mentioned in our Problem Statement, GWR helps users determine significant covariates because it allows for the estimation of local regression coefficients that could vary spatially but not revealed in a global model (such as OLS)\n\nUsing Spearman Correlation Coefficient (allows us to remove insignificant variables - if \\(p < 0.05\\))\nIt is a non-parametric measure of association that does not assume a linear relationship between variables and can be useful examining the local relationships that may vary spatially. Additionally, it is not heavily influenced by outliers.\n\nEvaluation of Models\n\n10-fold cross validation - helps to estimate the model‚Äôs generalisation error. Can be used to compare the different models created by the different inputs of the users.\nVIF - helps assess multicollinearity among the predictor variables.\nMoran‚Äôs I statistic - on model‚Äôs residuals to determine if they are spatially autocorrelated.\nAIC - lower values are desired as it implies a more parsimonious model.\nAdjusted\\(R^2\\) - a larger value indicates that the model can explain a larger variance of target.variable (i.e., COVID-19 vaccination rate) and is preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n Credit to TeamGantt for their gantt chart template.\n\n\n\nMollalo, A., & Tatar, M.
